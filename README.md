# gulp.expo
I have 3 web project that differ in content, but absolutely identical frontend: the same structure of .css , .js code and the same media content jpg,png,pdf,docx. Also I have a local web server running another copy of one of these projects - test version. Initially all changes are made on this copy locally, then there is deployment on all 3 web resource. To do "with hands" each time the same operation on different resources (3!!!) is horrible, and if operations will be 100 in a day, I will kill myself!? How much resource of human/time is lost? I'm tired of this hate and decided using a task runner called GULP to automate processes of my daily work. I hope you enjoy it and you will find this code useful! 
  p.s. I really want to see my code getting better every day, so I strongly recommend you pull it yourself, change, modify, add some new functionality or fix bugs, and then commit it into my repository! Thank you all in advance for participating ;-)
