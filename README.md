# gulp.expo
<h2>Motivation:</h2>
I have 3 web projects which have different content but absolutely identical frontend (the same structure of .css , .js code and the same media content jpg,png,pdf,docx). <br>
Also I have a local web server with another copy of one of these projects - test version. Initially all the changes are made on this copy locally, then there is deployment on all 3 web resources. It's horrible to do this copy each time manually, and if there would be 100 operations in a day, I will kill myself!?<br>
How much resource of human/time is lost? I've got tired of this hate and decided to use a task runner called GULP to automate processes of my daily work. I hope you enjoy it and you will find this code useful!<br>

<h3>p.s.</h2>
  I really want to see my code getting better every day, so I strongly recommend you pull it yourself, change, modify, add some new functionality or fix bugs, and then commit it into my repository! Thank you all in advance for participating ;-)
